			<h3 style="background: black; color: white">Introduction: Notes</h3>
			<p>In music theory, notes are the building blocks of music. They represent specific pitches and are written on a musical staff. Here are some key concepts related to notes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Notes are named after the first seven letters of the alphabet: A, B, C, D, E, F, G</li>
				<li>Each note can be modified by accidentals, such as sharps (#) or flats (b)</li>
				<li>Notes can be written on different lines or spaces of the musical staff</li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section id="scales" class="main-section">
			<h3 style="background: black; color: white">Scales</h3>
			<p>Scales are a series of notes played in ascending or descending order. They form the foundation of melodies and harmonies in music. Here are some important scales:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Major scale - A seven-note scale with a specific pattern of whole steps and half steps</li>
                <li>Minor scale - A seven-note scale with a different pattern of whole steps and half steps</li>
				<li>Pentatonic scale - A five-note scale often used in blues and rock music</li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section id="chords" class="main-section">
			<h3 style="background: black; color: white">Chords</h3>
			<p>Chords are groups of three or more notes played together. They provide harmony and are the basis of chord progressions in music. Here are some common types of chords:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Major chord - Consists of a root note, a major third, and a perfect fifth</li>
				<li>Minor chord - Consists of a root note, a minor third, and a perfect fifth</li>
				<li>Seventh chord - Consists of a root note, a major third, a perfect fifth, and a minor seventh</li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section id="intervals" class="main-section">
			<h3 style="background: black; color: white">Intervals</h3>
			<p>Intervals refer to the distance between two notes. They play a crucial role in music theory and help determine the relationships between different pitches. Here are some common intervals:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Major second - Two notes with a whole-step distance</li>
				<li>Minor third - Two notes with a distance of three half-steps</li>
				<li>Perfect fourth - Two notes with a distance of four half-steps</li>
				<li>Perfect fifth - Two notes with a distance of seven half-steps</li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section id="key-signatures" class="main-section">
			<h3 style="background: black; color: white">Key Signatures</h3>
			<p>Key signatures are a set of sharps or flats that appear at the beginning of a musical staff to indicate the key of a piece. They provide information about which notes to play as natural, sharp, or flat throughout the composition. Key signatures help determine the tonality and overall sound of a piece of music.</p>
